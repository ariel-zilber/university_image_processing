Question:
    The quantization procedure needs an initial segment division of [0..255] to segments, z. If a division
    will have a gray level segment with no pixels, the procedure will crash (Q1: Why?). In order
    to overcome this problem, you are required to set the initial division such that each segment will
    contain approximately the same number of pixels
Answer:
    The reason is that according to the  formula that we use to caluculate qi (the new gray level in segment i)
    that appears in page 57 of the lecture notes
    ("https://moodle2.cs.huji.ac.il/nu19/pluginfile.php/219284/mod_resource/content/1/course-19-01-intro-hist.pdf")
    some segmentation would have a total sum of 0 therefore the calculatation of qi would include
    a diviation of a number by 0 which python throws ZeroDivisionError exception
