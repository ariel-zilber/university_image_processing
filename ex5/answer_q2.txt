Question:
suggest how to use the workflow you have implemented in this assignment to train a network that could  be  used
for  super-resolution.   A  full  answer  consists  of  a  description  of  the  corruption  function,
and how to properly use therestore_image()function for this task.
For this context only, you could optionally add additional operations before calling to restore_image()
Solution:
In the case of image super-resolution we will use a similar workflow to the deblurring network we've implemented.
However,we will use  gaussian blur ,also   in restore_image we will change the images' size.

Lets take for example a network that will be larger by 2 folds.

validation and training dataset:
This database will be be built by  using images and their gaussian blur.
This means that the source batches will contain the images after gaussian blur  has been perfformed.
Also the target batches will contain the original images.

The corruption function:
A dictionary will be build.This dictionary returns from a given  blurred image the original one.
This every time the corruption function will be called on a blurred
image, the  dictionary's value will be returned.

restore_image will take an image to enlarge and then work in the following manner:
1. Train a model on patches of our data using the described corruption function.
2. Create an adjusted model tfor the size fitting.
3. Double the sizes of the image.
4. Gives the big image to the adjusted model to predict the results.
5.done
