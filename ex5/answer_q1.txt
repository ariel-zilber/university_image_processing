Question:
Describe the effect of increasing the residual blocks on its performance for each task,
 both quanti-tatively in terms of
 the plot you got and qualitatively in terms of the differences in the image outputs of each model

Solution:
The network's learning rate increases with  each addition of residual block. This is most seen in
that the first epoch's   validation loss decrease.
Also the   learning rate increase is also seen in the following epochs

However,  as the network converges it is not as much as in the first epoch.All graphs
that represent the same network ,however with a different number of resblocks appear to be roughly shifting one another
in the y axis.
In addition it does seem that having more depth in the network made the validation loss decrease become more continuous
and so appear more "natural".

Also, in the images that were produced from networks  denoising with more depth smoother surfaces and clearer
edges can be seen.
In the networks of the deblurring higher depth produces clearer edges and  less noisy images.
 The networks that have low count of  resblock the  blurring angles are very evident in the letters and it's hard to discern between close lines.
