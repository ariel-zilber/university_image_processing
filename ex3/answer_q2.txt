Q2: Blending is performed with different image filters (filter_size_im = 1,3,5,7...).

ANSWER:
The filter mask effects the seams between the images that are blended.When a higher pascal row filter is used,
 the area of the border will spread to  more pixels  and the
transition will appear more smooth.This is in contrast to lower pascal row filters which  will make an effect of
"pasting" one image upon the other, or a narrow area of border blur.
