Q3: Blending is performed with a varying number of pyramid levels (max_levels = 1,2,3,4,5,...).

ANSWER:
The total number of levels in the pyramid has an effect on
 the appearance of the borders of each image and the whole
output image.When using more levels, we get a better image(smoother).The reason is that we construct the
output image from the images created by the  laplacian pyramids.
When iterating over the pyramid levels a smoother border is achieved.
That is relevant for each image's pyramid borders  and for the
output  blended pyramid .
