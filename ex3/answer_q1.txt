Q1: What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value? What do we try to control on?

ANSWER:
What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value?
It means that each level is a different band pass filter.
This is why when applying a pascal row filter we can take levels
in differnt intensities and create filter on the picture
What do we try to control on?
The smoothness of the image.
when using a higher pascal row filter,more neighbour pixels are taken in the calculations and therefore the image
will be more blurry when iterating the pyramid layers.
That causes  the borders  in the images of the laplacian pyramid to be thicker.
So at the end a smoother image will be created
